# RecursionSchemes
This repository contains practical code examples in multiple languages for learning about recursion schemes.

Just dive into the directory named after your favorite language; `/schemes` contains the implementation of different recursion schemes while `/examples/<example>` applies them to some toy problem. 

There is no guarantee of correctness, and I had to make some interpretations to port them to Python, C++, and JavaScript. Nonetheless, I hope the short and naive implementation, as well as the examples, can help you in your journey.

[Awesome Recursion Schemes](https://github.com/passy/awesome-recursion-schemes) is an excellent curation of other resources.
